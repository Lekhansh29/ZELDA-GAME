# 🧠 How It Works
The game loop handles user input, updates character states, and renders the world every frame.

A sprite-based system is used for character animations and collisions.

Maps are loaded from layout files that define terrain and enemy placement.

Music and sound effects are triggered during events (e.g., attacking, getting hit).

# 💡 Future Plans
Add more enemy types and smarter AI

Inventory system and pickups

Save/load functionality

Boss battles and advanced levels
